        By January 2023, ChatGPT had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months.[8][9] ChatGPT's release spurred the release of competing products, including Gemini, Claude, Llama, Ernie, and Grok.[10] Microsoft launched Copilot, initially based on OpenAI's GPT-4. In May 2024, a partnership between Apple Inc. and OpenAI was announced, in which ChatGPT was integrated into the Apple Intelligence feature of Apple operating systems.[11] As of July 2024, ChatGPT's website is among the 10 most-visited websites globally.[12][13]
